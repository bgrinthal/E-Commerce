  ## Description
  
  - What was your motivation?

    Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes.

    My task was to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Youâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

  - What did you learn?
    
    I learned the fundamental architecture of the back end development of this e-commerce database as well as using Insomnia as a tool to navigate.
